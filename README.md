# Bruh Wiki
A trash attempt to create a wiki from scratch using JSP, HTML, CSS, and JS.

This is an assessment for my Object-Oriented Programming class lmao.

Learned the most important lesson in my life: **NEVER** use JSP for web development, and also, don't try to start one day before the deadline.
